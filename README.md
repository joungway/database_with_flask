# Description

This project is a small Flask application that includes a database to hold data about movies. The project 3 refers to the database diagram in Project 2 and implements that database in SQLAlchemy. It integrates models with the Flask framework to build a Flask app that uses databases for the first time by writing Python programming frameworks together to display data.


- The SI507_project3.py file allow user to go to the routes at the three paths.
- The '/ (home page)' allows a user of the application to save a new movie to his or her database.
- The '/movie/new/<title>/<director>/<genre>/') makes a query to the database and show some information on the page.
- The '/movies/<genre>' shows all the genres in movies that are available in the database.
- The '/all_directors' shows all the directors that are available in the database.
